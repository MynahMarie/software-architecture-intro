# The Importance of Software Architecture :european_post_office: :construction:

## Overview :globe_with_meridians: :

- Architecture is an abstraction of a system
    * Everything is built on layers
    * Define the properties of components -> makes assumptions
    * Well formed assumptions can save you a lot of hassle down the road

- Why is Software Architecture important?
    * Because it represents the **earliest design decisions**
        * These decisions are usually the hardest ones to change
        * They are the most critical to get right
    * A good architecture is the key to maintainable and reusable code

- What are Functional Requirements?
    * Functional Requirements define:
        * What the system must do
        * How will the different components will interact between one another (relationship)
        * What does "functioning properly" means to me in the context of the app I'm planning to build

## Important Quality Attributes :100: :heavy_check_mark: :

- **Modifiability**
- **Interoperability**:
  * Interoperability is the ability of a system or a product to work with other systems or products without special effort on     the part of the customer.
- **Availability**
- **Security**
- **Predictability**
- **Portability**

## Common Mistakes and Pitfalls :interrobang: :warning: :

- Lack of adequate architectural knowledge/experience

- Insufficient time spent on architectural design and analysis

- Failure to identify the quality drivers and design for them

- Failure to properly document and communicate the architecture

- Failure to understand that standards are not a replacement for software architecture

- Failure to make sure that the architecture directs the implementation

- Failure to evolve your architecture and properly document your progress/changes as you go
